                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>ed is the first ninja in 200 years to unlock the ancient, forbidden ways. He defied his clan and master,
                    casting off the balance and discipline that had shackled him all his life. Zed now offers power to those
                    who embrace knowledge of the shadows, and slays those who cling to ignorance.</p>
                <p>An orphan, Zed was taken in and trained by a great ninja master. Only one other student appeared to be Zed's
                    equal - the master's son, Shen. It seemed Zed could never win the favor of the master, as every match
                    between the rivals ended in a draw. Frustrated and jealous, he sought an advantage. The young ninja ventured
                    into a sealed part of the clan's temple, where he found an ornate, foreboding box. Sensing the dark knowledge
                    within, Zed knew he should not open it, but he peered inside nonetheless. In an instant, shadows touched
                    his mind, revealing techniques that had long been hidden. Now armed with a secret edge, he challenged
                    Shen, and this time he defeated the master's son. He expected praise and recognition in his moment of
                    victory, but somehow the master knew Zed had used forbidden ways, and banished him.</p>
                <p>Humiliated, the young ninja wandered for years. His bitterness turned to ambition, and he began to train
                    others in the style of the shadows. As his power grew, so did his circle of followers, but he knew that
                    without the box, his technique would never be perfect. One day, Zed looked at his followers and saw that
                    his students were now an army. He led them back to the temple to claim his prize. At the gates, he was
                    surprised to find the old master waiting, receiving Zed and his disciples as if they were welcome guests.
                    The old man laid his sword at Zed's feet, declaring that he had failed Zed as his master. By banishing
                    his former student, the master had doomed Zed to the shadows, instead of leading him to the balanced
                    path. The old man implored Zed to enter the temple, destroy the box, and lead his followers to balance.
                    The dark ninja followed the master inside. Moments later, the assembled ninjas heard Zed cry out in pain.
                    Mysteriously, he emerged unscathed, and threw the severed head of the master at Shen's feet. Screaming
                    in rage, Zed commanded his followers to slaughter the master's students and seize the box.</p>
                <p>That day, the old ninja order fell. Though many students died, some escaped thanks to Shen's heroic efforts.
                    Now the temple is a dark training ground for the Order of the Shadow. Zed rules as the Order's master,
                    and his edict is simple: perfect one's technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to embrace the shadows.</p>
